# Into The Badlands for FoundryVTT!

Implements basic character and item sheets for playing **Into The Badlands** by Ian Devlin in Foundry VTT. Into the Badlands is a Wild West rpg, drawing heavily on such great games as:

- Into the Odd & Electric Bastionland by Chris McDowell
- Cairn by Yochai Gal.
- Mothership by Sean McCoy
- Knave by Ben Milton

The code is based on the Cairn system for FoundryVTT, which in turn is based on the [Electric Bastionland](https://github.com/mvdleden/electric-bastionland-FoundryVTT/) system.
