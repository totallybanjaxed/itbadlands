# Into The Badlands for FoundryVTT!

Implements basic character and item sheets for playing [Into The Badlands](https://IntoTheBadlandsrpg.com) by [Ian Devlin](https://rapscallion.games) in Foundry VTT. Into the Badlands is a Wild West rpg, drawing heavily on such great games as:

- Into the Odd & Electric Bastionland by Chris McDowell
- Cairn by Yochai Gal.
- Mothership by Sean McCoy
- Knave by Ben Milton

The code is based on the [Cairn system](https://github.com/mvdleden/electric-bastionland-FoundryVTT/) for FoundryVTT (which in turn is based on the Electric Bastionland system).
